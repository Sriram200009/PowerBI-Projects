# üìä Customer Churn Analysis - Power BI Dashboard

Welcome to my Customer Churn Analysis project! This dashboard is the culmination of my exploration into the factors driving customer attrition within the banking sector, created using **Power BI** and **Power Query**.

## üì• Project Overview

**Customer churn**‚Äîalso known as customer attrition‚Äîis the rate at which customers discontinue their relationship with a business over a specific period. Understanding churn is crucial for financial institutions aiming to maintain a loyal customer base and enhance profitability.

### üéØ Objective

The primary goal of this analysis is to uncover the key factors contributing to the increased customer churn rate at a commercial bank. By providing actionable insights, business stakeholders can develop informed strategies to improve customer retention and reduce churn.

## üóÑÔ∏è About the Data

- **Source**: A CSV file containing 10,000 records from a commercial bank seeking to address its churn challenges.
- **Privacy Note**: All personally identifiable information (PII) has been removed to ensure customer privacy and data security.
- **Limitations**: The dataset focuses solely on salary-earning customers, which may influence the generalizability of the findings.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- **Power BI Desktop**: For data visualization and interactive dashboard creation.
- **Power Query**: For data cleaning, transformation, and modeling.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: For creating calculated measures.

## üìù Analytical Approach

### 1. **Data Preparation**

Data preparation is a critical step in any data analysis project. It ensures that the data is clean, consistent, and ready for meaningful analysis. Here's how I prepared the dataset for this project:

#### 1. **Importing and Initial Transformation**

##### Data Import:

##### Imported the raw data into Power BI Desktop.

Opened the Power Query editor to begin the data transformation process.

##### Renaming the Dataset:

Renamed the dataset from customer_churn_data to Customer_Data for clarity and better representation of its content.

##### Promoting Headers:

The dataset had an auto-generated header. Promoted the first row to serve as the header, ensuring column names accurately reflected the data they contained.

This was done using the "Use First Row as Headers" option in both the Home and Transform tabs of Power Query Editor.

##### Data Cleaning and Reduction

##### Removing Irrelevant Columns:

###### Eliminated the estimated_salary column:

Rationale: The column contained estimated values, and with the balance column available‚Äîwhich provides actual account balances‚Äîthe estimated_salary was considered less reliable and potentially redundant.

Action: Right-clicked on the estimated_salary column header and selected "Remove" to eliminate it from the dataset.

#### 2. **Data Categorization and Grouping**

Organizing data into meaningful categories enhances the analysis process. Here's how I categorized and grouped specific columns:

##### Categorizing products_number
###### Re-labeling Product Numbers:

The products_number column indicated the type of account a customer owns, represented numerically (1, 2, 3, 4).

Used the "Replace Values" option to change numeric identifiers to more descriptive labels:

Replaced 1 with "Product 1"

Replaced 2 with "Product 2"

Replaced 3 with "Product 3"

Replaced 4 with "Product 4"

Deleted the original numeric column after re-labeling to maintain data cleanliness.

##### Grouping Continuous Variables

To facilitate better analysis and visualization, I grouped continuous variables into categories.

##### Analyzing Column Profiles:

From the View tab, enabled Column Profile to examine the distribution and distinct values in each column.

##### Summary of Key Columns:

###### age:

60 distinct values ranging from 18 to 82.

###### credit_score:

354 distinct values ranging from 376 to 850.

###### balance:

649 distinct values ranging from 0 to 213,146.20.

##### Grouping Using Conditional Columns:

Employed the "Conditional Column" feature to create bins or groups for:

Age Groups (e.g., < 20, 21 - 30, 31 - 40, 41 - 50, 51 - 60, 61 - 70, > 71)

Credit Score Ranges (e.g., <=400, 401 - 500, 501 - 600, 601 - 700, 701 - 800, > 800)

3. Formatting

Ensuring data is intuitive and easy to interpret is essential, especially when presenting findings.

##### Converting Boolean Columns

The columns churn, active_member, and credit_card used binary values (0 and 1) to represent statuses. To make the data more understandable:

##### active_member:

Replaced 0 with "InActive"

Replaced 1 with "Active"

##### churn:

Replaced 0 with "Yes"

Replaced 1 with "No"

##### credit_card:

Replaced 0 with "Not Owned"

Replaced 1 with "Owned"

##### Adjusting Data Types
Verified and adjusted data types for all columns to ensure accuracy in calculations and visualizations.

For example, ensured that numerical data was set to Whole Number or Decimal Number as appropriate, and categorical data was set to Text.

4. Data Transformation

Further transformations were performed to enhance data usability and reporting capabilities.

##### Handling Custom Sorting Issues

###### Problem:

After grouping some columns and introducing symbols (e.g., <, >=) in group labels, sorting became inconsistent because the system sorted alphanumerically, not logically.

###### Solution:

Creating Reference Tables:

For each affected column (age, credit_score, balance), created a new reference table:

Right-clicked on the original query in the Queries pane and selected "Reference".

##### Removing Unnecessary Columns:

In each reference table, removed all columns except the one of interest.

##### Eliminating Duplicates:

Removed duplicate rows to have a list of unique group labels.

##### Adding Index for Custom Sort Order:

Added an Index Column that assigns a numerical value representing the desired sort order.

Used the "Conditional Column" option to manually set index values based on logical order.

##### Changing Data Types:

Ensured the index columns were set to Whole Number data type for proper sorting.

##### Implementing Custom Sort in the Model:

In the main data table, used the "Sort By Column" feature to sort the grouped column based on the index from the reference table.

##### Renaming Columns for Clarity

Updated column names to be more descriptive, enhancing readability in reports and visualizations:

active_member ‚ûî "Active Status"

customer_id ‚ûî "Customer ID"

balance ‚ûî "Account Balance"

products_number ‚ûî "Product"

5. Finalizing Data Preparation

After completing all transformations and verifications:

Clicked on "Close & Apply" in Power Query Editor.

Loaded the cleaned and transformed data into Power BI for analysis and visualization.

Result:

Ended up with four well-structured tables ready for data modeling and report creation.

### 2. **Data Modeling**

Understanding and defining relationships between tables is crucial for accurate data analysis and visualization.

#### **Exploring Table Relationships**

- **Assessing Relationships**:
  - Examined the relationships between the tables created during data preparation.
  - Ensured that all fact tables were positioned above the dimension tables in the model view for clarity.

- **Configuring Relationships**:
  - **Cardinality**:
    - Power BI automatically detected the cardinality as **Many-to-One**, which is correct for this dataset.
  - **Arranging Tables**:
    - Organized the tables logically to reflect their relationships, making the data model easier to understand and maintain.

### 3. **Visualization ‚Äî Report**

Visualization transforms data into actionable insights. Here's how I built the report:

#### **Creating DAX Measures**

**DAX** (Data Analysis Expressions) is a formula language in Power BI used for calculations and data analysis.

##### **Measures Created**:

1. **Customers (Number of Customers)**

   - **Formula**:
     ```DAX
    No of Customers = count (Customer_Data[Customer_ID])
     ```
   - **Explanation**:
     - Counts the unique customer IDs to determine the total number of customers.
   - **Result**:
     - **Customers**: **10,000**

2. **Customers Churned**

   - **Formula**:
     ```DAX
    Customer Churned = CALCULATE(COUNT(Customer_Data[Churn]), Customer_Data[Churn] = "Yes")
       )
     ```
   - **Explanation**:
     - Calculates the number of customers who have churned.
   - **Result**:
     - **Customers Churned**: **2,037**

3. **Churn Rate (%)**

   - **Formula**:
     ```DAX
     Churn Rate = 'Customer Data'[Customers Churned] / 'Customer Data'[Customers]
     ```
   - **Explanation**:
     - Computes the churn rate as a percentage of total customers.
   - **Result**:
     - **Churn Rate**: **20.4%** (Formatted as a percentage)

#### **Building the Report**

- **Key Factors Analyzed**:
  - Account Balance
  - Age Group
  - Activity Status
  - Gender
  - Credit Score
  - Product Type

- **Visualizations Used**:
  - **Bar Charts**: To compare churn rates across different categories.
  - **Pie Charts**: To show the proportion of churned vs. retained customers.
  - **Slicers**: For interactive filtering by country, gender, and product type.
  - **Line Charts**: To observe trends over age groups or credit score ranges.

- **Interactive Elements**:
  - Enabled cross-filtering to see how different factors influence churn collectively.
  - Included tooltips with additional insights when hovering over data points.
